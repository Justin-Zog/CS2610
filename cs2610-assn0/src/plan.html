      <h2> Phase 0: Requirements and Specifications </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Create a website for a fictional client. This will include a main page, about me page, and tech tips with and without CSS for the geeks. </li>
        <li> The website also needs to use an assortment of HTML5 tags and include some CSS properties and selectors. </li>
        <li> I think this assignment will not be hard, but will be a bit time consuming as I am not very familiar with HTML or CSS. </li>
        <li> The only input this site takes is the user clicking on a hyperlink to other pages of the website. No real formula or special sauce there. </li>
      </ol>

    <div>
      <h2> Phase 1: Design </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>
      <h3> Main Page </h3>
      <p> The main page will consist of a title that is rendered using a `h1` or `h2` tag. 
          It will also have a byline the gives the name of the blog post and author with the date it was posted.
          It will also include a body that is more than 300 words long. Lorem Ipsum nonsense is okay to fill the `&lt;p&gt;` with.
      </p>

      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Includes a photo of the client and a 3 paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) sketch of the clients life. (Lorem Ipsum nonsense is okay here too). </li>
        <li> Also includes 2-3 other pictures that showcase how awesome the client is. These images must be actual image files, not links to some image hosted elsewhere. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3> Tech Tips with and withous CSS </h3>
      <p> These pages will look almost identical but one will use CSS and the other will only use HTML. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Includes a cheatsheet of html and css used to create the site. </li>
        <li> The elements included in the cheatsheet will be HTML Elements, HTML Character Entitites, CSS Selectors, and CSS Properties. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2> Phase 2: Implementation </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>
      
      <p> <em> Implemented: </em> Always close a tag as soon as you create one! </p>

    </div>

      <h2> Phase 3: Testing &amp; Debugging </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>

      <p> I tested my code against the w3.html and css validators. Everything but index.html shows no warnings or errors. The warning in index.html is just a comment on how the page contains Lorem Ipsum font and may not be an &quot;en&quot; page. </p>
      <p> I ran into a weird error on one of my pages because everything was being centered. Turns out I just forgot to close a header tag so the CSS was being applied to everything below it. </p>

    </div>

    <div>

      <h2> Phase 4: Deployment </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>

      <p> Everything is pushed to gitLab and confirmed with the official websites. </p>

    </div>

    <div>

      <h2> Phase 5: Maintenance </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>

      <p> The Techtips-css page is sloppy and hard to understand... But that is by design. I will never write any webpage like that in the future.  </p>
      <p> If a bug is reported in a few months I should be able to find it really quickly. The files are small and it should be fairly obvious what is causing the bug. </p>
      <p> My documentation should make sense. It is just a light outline of what the webpage should look like. </p>
      <p> Adding a new feature to this webpage should be easy for all pages but the techtips-css page. I think that this webpage should continue working for a long while too. That's just how html and css are though. </p>
