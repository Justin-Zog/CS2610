      <h2> Phase 0: Requirements and Specifications </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Learn HTTP and how it is used by servers </li>
        <li> Read Documentation to find out how to host our webpage through a server </li>
        <li> Handle Errors and alternate filepath names </li>
        <li> The server will take in input from the user in the form of a 'filepath' request </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Phase 1: Design </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>
      <p> I want a function that handles all of my filetypes no matter the kind.<br>
      It will take the file the user input and decide what to do with it.<br>
      If the file is an alternate name then the function will use a 301 request and perform another do_GET request with the correct pathname<br>
      If the file is recognized it will do a 200 and send the correct headers, etc.<br>
      An unrecognized path will take the user to the 404 page.<br></p>
      <p>There will be another function that takes care of sending the correct headers for the type of response (200, 301, etc.)</p>
    </div>

    <div>

      <h2> Phase 2: Implementation </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>
      
      <p> I ran into various bugs and oddities while learning about servers and writing my code. </p>
      <p> One was the Broken Pipe Error. It's an odd one but one that I can't do anything about. </p>
      <p> I had other errors that occurred throughout the project but using netcat really helped me solve them quickly </p>

    </div>

    <div>

      <h2> Phase 3: Testing &amp; Debugging </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>

      <p> I kept getting a broken pipe error. After doing some research I determined that this was because I was writing
        the <code> Connection: close </code> header before some of the others. Once I fixed that and implemented the
      <code> end_headers </code> this error was mostly solved... Except for at random times. This confused me but
      Professor Falor helped clear my concerns. </p>

      <p> I kept getting a weird error where the server would send the headers two times instead of one and display the
        second sent headers on my debugging page only. This was solved by putting a <code> return </code> in the function so the code at
      the bottom didn't get hit (sending the second sendHeaders) </p>

      <p> I also ran into an odd problem in only safari where if I typed a bogus url in <code> http://localhost:8000/fluffy minutia</code>
      Safari would automagically perform a search for the entire url instead of taking me to the 404 page. I never solved
      this error. I think it just a quirk of Safari and typing in the above url on other browsers took me to the 404 page.</p>

      <p> I tested all the alternate links and inspected the network tab to make sure my server was sending the correct codes.</p>

    </div>

    <div>

      <h2> Phase 4: Deployment </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>

      <p> Everything is pushed to gitLab and confirmed with the official websites. </p>

    </div>

    <div>

      <h2> Phase 5: Maintenance </h2>
      <h2> Deliver </h2>

      <p> I feel like my <code> sendHeaders </code> function could have been written in a more organized way.
      I also feel like I shouldn't need as many <code> if statement </code> to check for alternate pathnames but I do not know of any other way I could implement this. </p>
      <p> If a bug is reported in a few months I should be able to find it fairly quickly. The files are small and it should be fairly obvious what is causing the bug if netcat is used. </p>
      <p> My documentation should make sense. Hopefully it will allow others to see the errors I made and avoid them in the future. </p>
      <p> This server should keep working for a long time... Unless the world decides to suddenly change HTTP and the headers. Then the whole world would be a mess (more for HTTPS). </p>
